=Intro=
Ramdom web development stuff. Right now I've been working on a flashcard type application and a bullet-hell type game. I've been using [https://github.com/silconsystem/danmaku Silcon's Danmaku] as a starting point.

=Bullets=

=Quickstart=
*[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-django Django on heroku]
#Clone the repository git clone <repo>
#Create venv - virtualenv venv
#source venv/bin/activate
#install requirements - pip install -r requirements.txt ([http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/usage.html pip usage])
#python manage.py runserver (from within the project directory).




For any subsequent times you want to test this out, simply use source venv/bin/activate to go to start the python virtual environment in your terminal.


=Creating a virtual environment=
I have included a requuirements.txt, which can be used to create a clean python library to test things with.

=Git commands=
*git rm -r --cached . then git add .

=Implementation=
Right now I'm using [https://mongolab.com Mongolab] to host my mongodb and [https://www.heroku.com/ heroku] to host the app itself.
